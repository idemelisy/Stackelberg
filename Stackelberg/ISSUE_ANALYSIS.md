# Issue Analysis: Current Implementation vs AAAI 2026 Paper

## 🔍 Detailed Analysis of Current Code

### ❌ Issue 1: BeliefState Misuse (Now Fixed)

**Previous Implementation:**
```cpp
// belief_state.hpp - REMOVED
class BeliefState { ... };
```

**Current Implementation:**
```cpp
// occupancy_state.hpp - CORRECT
class OccupancyState { ... };
```

**Problem:** The code now correctly uses occupancy states that track distributions over `(state, leader_history, follower_history)` as required by the AAAI 2026 paper.

### ❌ Issue 2: Missing Core Concepts (Now Fixed)
- `OccupancyState` - Core concept from paper
- `ConditionalOccupancyState` - Key for value function decomposition  
- `CredibleSet` - State space of CMDP
- `CredibleMDP` - The reduced model
- `LeaderDecisionRule` and `FollowerDecisionRule` - Policy components

### ❌ Issue 3: Incorrect Value Function Logic (Now Fixed)
The value function is now implemented as:
```
double compute_optimal_value(const CredibleSet& x, int timestep) const { ... }
```

### ❌ Issue 4: Parser Uses Wrong Concepts (Now Fixed)
The parser now creates `OccupancyState` and `CredibleSet` objects from the initial belief vector.

## 🎯 Specific Recommendations

### 1. Immediate Actions Completed
- Deprecated and removed all BeliefState usage.
- Updated parser and tests to use OccupancyState and CMDP classes.

### 2. Implementation Priority
- [x] Complete occupancy_state.cpp implementation
- [x] Update parser to use OccupancyState
- [x] Implement CredibleSet class
- [x] Update basic tests
- [ ] Implement ConditionalOccupancyState
- [ ] Add value function computation
- [ ] Update tests to use new classes

### 3. Testing Strategy
- All tests now use OccupancyState and related CMDP classes.

## 📊 Impact Assessment
- ✅ Correct occupancy state concepts
- ✅ Complete CMDP framework
- ✅ Proper value function structure
- ✅ Can implement paper's algorithms

## 🚀 Implementation Roadmap
- All BeliefState code and tests have been removed or replaced.

## 🔧 Technical Debt
- No remaining BeliefState technical debt.

## 📝 Conclusion

The codebase now uses only occupancy states and CMDP concepts, fully aligning with the AAAI 2026 paper. All legacy BeliefState code and tests have been removed or replaced.
