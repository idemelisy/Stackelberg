# Refactoring Plan: Implementing AAAI 2026 Paper Concepts

## ‚ùå Critical Issues with Previous Implementation

### 1. **Incorrect Belief State Usage (Now Removed)**
The previous `BeliefState` class (traditional POMDP) has been fully removed. The AAAI 2026 paper requires:

- **OccupancyState**: Distribution over `(state, leader_history, follower_history)`
- **ConditionalOccupancyState**: Distribution over `(state, leader_history)` conditioned on follower history
- **CredibleSet**: A set of occupancy states

### 2. **Missing Core Concepts (Now Implemented)**
The CMDP approach now uses:
- `OccupancyState` class
- `ConditionalOccupancyState` class  
- `CredibleSet` class
- `CredibleMDP` class
- Value function classes with the correct structure

### 3. **Incorrect Value Function Logic (Now Fixed)**
The value function structure is:
```
vL*(x) = max_œÉL min_œÉF E_{o‚ààx}[rL(o)]
```

## ‚úÖ Refactoring Summary

### Phase 1: Replace Belief States with Occupancy States (DONE)
- All code and tests now use OccupancyState and related CMDP concepts.

### Phase 2: Update Parser to Use Occupancy States (DONE)
- The parser creates `OccupancyState` objects from the initial belief vector.

### Phase 3: Implement CMDP Value Functions (IN PROGRESS)
- Value function and PBVI logic are being implemented using the new classes.

### Phase 4: Update Tests (IN PROGRESS)
- All tests now use OccupancyState. Any legacy BeliefState tests have been removed or replaced.

## üîß Specific Code Changes Completed
- Removed all references to BeliefState.
- Updated all code, parser, and tests to use OccupancyState and CMDP classes.
- Updated documentation and checklists accordingly.

- [x] Implement `conditional_occupancy_state.cpp`
- [x] Implement `credible_set.cpp`
- [x] Implement `credible_mdp.cpp`
- [x] Update parser to use occupancy states
- [x] Update tests to use new classes
- [ ] Add CMDP value function tests
- [ ] Add PBVI algorithm tests
- [x] Update Makefile to include new files
- [x] Update documentation

## üéØ Key Concepts from Paper

### Occupancy State (Section 3)
- Distribution over `(state, leader_history, follower_history)`
- Represents leader's belief about joint state and histories
- Enables tracking of information asymmetry

### Conditional Occupancy State (Section 4)
- Distribution over `(state, leader_history)` conditioned on follower history
- Enables decomposition for value function computation
- Key for uniform continuity properties

### Credible Set (Section 3)
- Set of occupancy states reachable under some follower response
- State space of the Credible MDP
- Enables strategic reasoning over follower rationality

### Credible MDP (Section 3)
- Lossless reduction of leader-follower POSG
- Embeds rational follower responses into state dynamics
- Enables dynamic programming methods

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Complete the implementation files** I've started
2. **Update the parser** to use occupancy states instead of belief states
3. **Implement the CMDP value functions** as per Section 4 of the paper
4. **Add PBVI algorithm** as per Section 5 of the paper
5. **Update all tests** to use the new concepts
6. **Remove deprecated belief state usage**

This refactoring will align your implementation with the AAAI 2026 paper's theoretical framework and enable the correct computation of Œµ-optimal solutions for leader-follower POSGs.
